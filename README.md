Summary

This project showcases my skills in C#, .NET, WPF, and Windows Forms through the development of a custom SolidWorks Add-In. The Add-In streamlines various engineering workflows, demonstrating my ability to solve practical problems in a CAD environment. This repository highlights my expertise in:

Developing and integrating custom add-ins for complex software ecosystems.

Building user interfaces with WPF and Windows Forms.

Debugging and testing in specialized environments such as SolidWorks.

Implementing efficient algorithms for batch processing and data management.

My Contributions

Project Architecture

The solution consists of three distinct projects, each serving a unique purpose:

SWAddin (WPF):

Developed a modern, user-friendly interface using WPF.

Integrated advanced features like batch processing and property management into the SolidWorks environment.

WFHost (Windows Forms):

Created the host application to interface with SolidWorks, ensuring seamless communication with the Add-In.

Handled SolidWorks-specific COM interactions, showcasing expertise in working with legacy systems.

HostApp:

Designed and implemented a standalone debugging tool to test and troubleshoot the Add-In functionality without relying on SolidWorks, significantly speeding up development.

Core Features

I developed several key functionalities to enhance the SolidWorks experience:

Batch Processing:

Automated the creation of structural profiles.

Streamlined bulk exports to DXF and STEP formats, improving workflow efficiency.

Property Management:

Implemented a tool for adding custom properties to multiple parts or assemblies at once.

Drawing Operations:

Created tools for optimizing and managing SolidWorks drawings.

Feature Tree Management:

Developed a sorting algorithm to organize the assembly feature tree for better usability.

Challenges and Solutions

Integration with SolidWorks:

Navigated complex SolidWorks API and COM interactions to integrate seamlessly with the application.

User Interface Development:

Designed a responsive and intuitive WPF interface for advanced features, ensuring usability and performance.

Debugging in a Specialized Environment:

Built the HostApp tool to simulate SolidWorks behavior, overcoming the challenges of testing in a tightly coupled environment.
