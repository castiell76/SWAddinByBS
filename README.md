# SolidWorks Add-In Project

## Summary
This project showcases my skills in **C#**, **.NET**, **WPF**, and **Windows Forms** through the development of a custom SolidWorks Add-In. The Add-In streamlines various engineering workflows, demonstrating my ability to solve practical problems in a CAD environment. This repository highlights my expertise in:

- Developing and integrating custom add-ins for complex software ecosystems.
- Building user interfaces with **WPF** and **Windows Forms**.
- Debugging and testing in specialized environments such as SolidWorks.
- Implementing efficient algorithms for batch processing and data management.

## My Contributions
### Project Architecture
The solution consists of three distinct projects, each serving a unique purpose:

1. **SWAddin (WPF)**:
   - Developed a modern, user-friendly interface using **WPF**.
   - Integrated advanced features like batch processing and property management into the SolidWorks environment.
   
2. **WFHost (Windows Forms)**:
   - Created the host application to interface with SolidWorks, ensuring seamless communication with the Add-In.
   - Handled SolidWorks-specific **COM** interactions, showcasing expertise in working with legacy systems.

3. **HostApp**:
   - Designed and implemented a standalone debugging tool to test and troubleshoot the Add-In functionality without relying on SolidWorks, significantly speeding up development.

### Core Features
I developed several key functionalities to enhance the SolidWorks experience:

- **Batch Processing**:
  - Automated the creation of structural profiles.
  - Streamlined bulk exports to **DXF** and **STEP** formats, improving workflow efficiency.

- **Property Management**:
  - Implemented a tool for adding custom properties to multiple parts or assemblies at once.
  - Bulk exports to .xslx bill of materials file

- **Drawing Operations**:
  - Created tools for optimizing and managing SolidWorks drawings.

- **Feature Tree Management**:
  - Developed a sorting algorithm to organize the assembly feature tree for better usability.
 
- **Bulk converting to sheet**:
  - Developed a sheet converting algorithm to replace import files with sheets.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Integration with SolidWorks**:
  - Navigated complex SolidWorks API and **COM** interactions to integrate seamlessly with the application.

- **User Interface Development**:
  - Designed a responsive and intuitive **WPF** interface for advanced features, ensuring usability and performance.

- **Debugging in a Specialized Environment**:
  - Built the **HostApp** tool to simulate SolidWorks behavior, overcoming the challenges of testing in a tightly coupled environment.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Programming Languages**: C#, .NET Framework.
- **UI Frameworks**: WPF, Windows Forms.
- **CAD API Expertise**: SolidWorks API, COM interoperability.
- **Debugging Tools**: Visual Studio, custom debugging utilities.
- **Software Architecture**: Modular design, separation of concerns.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling real-world engineering challenges with tailored software solutions.

## Impact
This project significantly reduces the time and effort required for repetitive tasks in SolidWorks, making it an invaluable tool for engineers. It highlights my ability to identify bottlenecks in workflows and implement innovative solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing systems.

## How This Relates to My Career Goals
This project demonstrates my ability to develop practical software solutions for technical users, showcasing a strong foundation in back-end and desktop application development. It bridges my engineering background with software development, aligning with my goal to transition into full-stack or back-end roles in IT.
